          Twenty Eight years ago, I laid the foundation of my dream project –
          Montessori Group of Institutions.In these twenty eight years, India
          has been abundantly blessed with material wealth and economic
          progress.But economic wealth is not enough to shape a future. The real
          wealth of our nation lies in the intellectual power of our future
          generations.We, at Montessori, believe that it is our role to enhance
          this intellectual wealth for our next generation.I have since made it
          my commitment to equip young India with all the tools, skills and know
          – how it requires to stand toe to toe with the best in the world.
          Education is not simply about academic achievement.For me, it has
          always been about being a global citizen. – One who cares for and is
          empowered by the challenges of our future society. This can only be
          realized by imparting quality education, specially focused on
          development of “KASSM” (Knowledge, Attitude, Skills, Social and Moral
          values). At Montessori schools, we are nurturing and building these
          citizens every day, both within and outside the classroom.

        <p className="i-am-dedicated">
          But even though we are looking towards the future, at Montessori, our
          foundations are deeply – rooted. We stay true to our traditions while
          adapting to the pace of progress. Prayers have always been a strong
          moral foundation. I strongly believe that in Montessori each
          stakeholder will be benefitted to reach the goal in the specified
          field.
