There are many things that I admire about the school, Friendly and safe environment, brilliant teachers and modern learning. Along with regular academics, IIT & NEET are also being taught by excellent teachers. My son is actively participating in co- curricular activities like cricket ,Music (Drums) and he is doing well in it. I am very much satisfied with the hostel facilities and food. We are happy and fortunate to have chosen Montessori Prime School as our Sonâ€™s centre of learning. Much Gratitude any many thanks!!!`}</div>
